    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to provide a secure and scalable solution for the Medo.Ai Time Hub application, focusing on efficient file storage and retrieval, and user management. The design adheres to the core principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs. It leverages Structural Segregation to ensure each collection has a homogeneous security posture and Access Modeling for consistent authorization patterns.\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved by denormalizing the `userId` into the `uploadedFiles` collection. This eliminates the need for `get()` calls to the `/users/{userId}` document to verify ownership, allowing for atomic operations and simplified security rules.\n\nThe design supports QAPs by segregating user-specific files under the `/users/{userId}/uploadedFiles/{fileId}` path. This ensures that listing files is restricted to authorized users only, as security rules can easily enforce that only the user with the matching `userId` can access these files. This also provides a clear ownership model, making security rules simple and robust."
