## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke a sense of calm and clarity related to time.
- Background color: Very light grayish-blue (#F0F8FF), offering a subtle backdrop that doesn't distract from the time and date information.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to highlight important elements like the developer's name or to differentiate between the types of date displays.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font, should be used for displaying all information (developer name, dates, time) due to its modern look and legibility.
- Minimal use of icons; consider a simple clock icon or calendar icon if space allows, in a muted tone.
- Clean, centered layout. Prioritize readability of the time and dates, with the developer's name subtly placed.
- Subtle transitions for the clock's second updates for a modern feel.
